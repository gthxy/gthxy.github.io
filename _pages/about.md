I am a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University, working in the <a href='https://ultrasound.gatech.edu/'>Ultrasound Imaging and Therapeutics Research Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://bme.gatech.edu/bio/stanislav-emelianov'>Dr. Stanislav Emelianov</a>. During my Ph.D., I also earned a master in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I have interned at <a href='https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/'>Meta Reality Labs</a>.

My research focuses on developing ultrasound-based imaging techniques, including ultrasound, photoacoustic, elasticity, and Doppler imaging. I believe that ultrasound is a powerful and versatile modality capable of revealing far more information than traditionally recognized. My work integrates signal and image processing to create new imaging methods and applications for multi-scale hemodynamic assessment, from microcirculation to large-vessel dynamics.

Before joining GT/Emory, I completed my undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, co-advised by <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/academic-and-teaching-staff/prof-puxiang-lai/?sc_lang=en'>Dr. Puxiang Lai</a> and <a href='https://www.polyu.edu.hk/bme/people/academic-and-teaching-staff/prof-chunyi-wen/?sc_lang=en'>Dr. Chunyi Wen</a>. I then earned my master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, co-advised by <a href='https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/kai-ding/2777666'>Dr. Kai Ding</a> and <a href='https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/muyinatu-bell/'>Dr. Muyinatu Bell</a>.

I am originally from China, born in the south and raised in the northeast.
